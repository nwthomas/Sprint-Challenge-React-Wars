1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React.js is a library (_not_ a framework) that allows you to build compact, reusable components out of your application or website. This not only allows for reusability and extensibility, but it makes for a cleaner development experience. Additionally, as DOM changes are quite expensive in terms of efficiency, React's virtual DOM reconciles the current real DOM against it and only updates the components that have changes since the last update. This is much more efficient as the entire page seldom needs to be refreshed every time a change is made. Finally, we also have other breakthroughs that React.js allows us to use such as using state to hold data and using it to make the previously-mentioned changes.
